- ## Hi there, my name is Jennifer and I am a Pharmacology Ph.D. Student at Emory University .. ##

- ðŸ”¬ I am conducting research in the Spencer Lab at the AFLAC Pediatric Cancer & Blood Disorders Center of Childrenâ€™s Healthcare of Atlanta.
- ðŸ©¸ At the Spencer Lab I am studying hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy for Hemophilia A as well as Sickle Cell Disease.
- ðŸ§ª I am specifically interested in developing nongenotoxic conditioning regimens to prepare patients for bone marrow transplants.
- ðŸ§¬ By studying gene therapy, I ultimately hope to help take a cure from the bench top to the bed of a patient.
